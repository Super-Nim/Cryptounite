# Cryptounite App

Learning Full Stack dev + blockchain dev, through my own original HTML/CSS/JS project. Now, using MERN stack + Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Pure CSS is used, as I want to improve my skills. However, frameworks such as MaterialUI/Bootstrap will be applied later.

## Project Aim

The purpose of this project is to create a MERN stack application that will incorporate smart contracts to distribute money.

This will incorporate the Ethereum Virtual Machine to deploy the application, once the current objectives have been met.



### Current objectives

* Incorporate JSON Web Tokens for authentication
* Create a basic profile page
* Fix CSS media queries at very small & big screen sizes

A MongoDB database is used to store customer accounts using a REST API. 

Authentication code for front end and back end has been implemented. For example, the below image shows what is required for a password.
